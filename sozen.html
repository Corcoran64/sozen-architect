                <p>A modern home where everything has its place. A home that is
                    perhaps a little bold and adventurous, but remarkably functional
                    and efficient too. You love your neighbourhood and its corner coffee shop,
                    and want a home that belongs. A house that is a little brave, a little
                    different, but intrinsically you.</p>

                <p class="testimonial-para">"My wife and I initially made enquiries with a
                    number of architects & builders; however, we chose to work with Simon
                    from SoZen Architects as she actually took the time to listen to our requirements,
                    rather than forcing her ideas onto us.”</p>
