                    <p>A modern home where everything has its place. A home that is
                        perhaps a little bold and adventurous, but remarkably functional
                        and efficient too. You love your neighbourhood and its corner coffee shop,
                        and want a home that belongs. A house that is a little brave, a little
                        different, but intrinsically you.</p>

                        from SoZen Architects as she actually took the time to listen to our requirements,
